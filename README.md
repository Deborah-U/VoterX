# VoterX
## 💡 Inspiration

Voting has been an essential part of our democracy here in the U.S., but some people are not fully knowledgeable about all the candidates. 🇺🇸  Many people only know about the candidates that have _good_ publicist and marketing teams. We made VoterX to help voting citizens to make informed and educated choices by learning more about **ALL** candidates.  🗳️


## 💻 What it does

- Finds local elections based on the user’s address. 📭
- Builds user’s profiles by data scraping their social media (Twitter or Facebook), writing a short paragraph about their political views, or filling out a survey about their future goals and values. 📝
- Match users with candidates that closely line up with their political views, future goals, and values. 🎯

## 🔨 How we built it

- We first brainstormed ideas and made a prototype on Figma. 
- We then used replit to bring our prototype alive.


## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Designing a web app on Figma, as it was our first time. 🎨
- Dealing with teammate’s time difference. 🕐


## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completing a project that can help voters know more about local elections, make more informed votes, and be a more involved citizen! 🇺🇸 

## 📖 What we learned

- How to design a web app on Figma.


## 🚀 What's next for _VoterX_

- Making an ios and android app
- Having a feature to let users vote right on the app
